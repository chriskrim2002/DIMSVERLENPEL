DIMSVERLENPEL is building a decentralized ecosystem for seamless cross-chain interaction. Our Minimum Viable Product (MVP) will focus on the DIMS component, a self-sovereign identity solution. Users will be able to create and manage their digital identities, secured through Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs), initially on the Ethereum and Tezos blockchains. This will enable cross-chain identity verification, laying the foundation for secure and interoperable access to future platform features like cross-chain lending and decentralized exchange, planned for later stages.
